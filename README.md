# demoOpencart

Developed a selenium hybrid automation framework to automate https://demo.opencart.com/ website.

## Automated the following scenarios:

    1.Registration of new user
    2.Login existing user
    3.Ordering a product
    4.Wishlist functionality
    5.Sorting functionality
    
## Note:

* Here I have used the Page Object Model (POM) concept and used "testNG" for the validation of testcases.
* Used Apache POI for login functionality and passed the login credentials from the Excel sheet.
* Captured the screenshots of failed testcases.
* Added loggers , performed cross browser testing , used testng concepts like dataproviders , listners etc.
* I have also ran this project using maven/cmd and on jenkins 


## Generated the Extent Reports:
